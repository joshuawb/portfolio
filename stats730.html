                <!-- Grade Achieved -->
                <h2>Grade Achieved</h2>
                <p>A</p>

                <!-- Course Prescription -->
                <h2>Course Prescription</h2>
                <p>Fundamental topics in estimation and statistical inference. Advanced topics in modelling including regression with dependent data, survival analysis, and methods to handle missing data. Advanced topics in current statistical practice researched by students. Students will undertake and present individual research projects on assigned topics, consisting of a literature search and a computational application to a data analysis task.</p>

                <!-- Course Overview -->
                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                <p>STATS&nbsp;730 consists of interactive lectures covering classical and advanced aspects of statistical inference and individually assigned research projects to be presented in class. The lecture component begins with simple maximum likelihood concepts and a discussion of point estimators, including methods to find them and key properties such as mean squared error, sufficiency, ancillarity, and unbiasedness. (Asymptotic efficiency is also discussed in the second half of the course.) The Halmos–Savage, Rao–Blackwell and Cramér–Rao theorems are discussed and applied. This segment is followed by an in‑depth consideration of the likelihood‑based frequentist approach to inference. Simple and not‑so‑simple (e.g., finite mixture model) examples based on iid samples are presented. The essential properties, concepts, and tools of maximum‑likelihood inference are then presented with equal focus on theory (e.g., asymptotic evaluations) and applications. Maximum likelihood and extensions are applied in a wide variety of settings with examples in R, with special attention to exponential families applied to generalised linear modelling. The course concludes with extensions of maximum likelihood for more challenging situations, including quasi‑likelihood and conditional likelihood.</p>
                <p>The research component consists of an assigned project to be completed in two phases, based on an assigned topic, a research question and a given data set: (1) a literature review and description of the methods to be applied to answer the research question using the data; (2) the results of the analysis. Each phase will be presented by the students and be the object of an assessed in‑class quiz co‑created by the presenting students and the instructors. Topics will be varied and current, taken from areas such as dependent data, survival analysis, methods to handle missing data, predictive analytics, causal inference, semi‑parametric inference, and others.</p>
                <p><em>Prior familiarity with R is strongly advised for those undertaking this course.</em></p>
