                <!-- Course Overview -->
                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                <p>STATS&nbsp;769 is intended to provide students with computing concepts and skills involved in the acquisition, manipulation, and analysis of large and/or complex data sets. A secondary aim is to give students practice in applying data mining and machine learning techniques, data mining tools, working with large datasets, computer clusters, parallel and large memory computing. The course will assume a certain amount of basic computing knowledge and familiarity with R, such as might be obtained by completion of STATS&nbsp;220, STATS&nbsp;380, or STATS&nbsp;782. This course is relevant for a career in Data Science.</p>
